    return "The development of neurotechnologies can be traced back to 19th century with the work of Richard Caton who used a galvanometer to observe electrical impulses from the surfaces of living brains in 1875.In 1890, Adolf Beck highlighted the existence of Brain Waves.In 1912 Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich Neminsky published the first animal EEG.In 1924, Hans Berger recorded the first human EEG.During the the 30’s, Ferdinando Cazzamalli conducted experiments to highlight existence of electromagnetic radiation produced by brain electrical activity.In 1938, Isidor Isaac Rabi discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, the principle that underlies both MRI and atomic magnetometry.During the 40's, Wilder Penfield, a neurosurgeon, began mapping the human brain to understand which areas were responsible for different sensory and motor functions. He created the Cortical Homunculus, a map of the brain.During the 50's, Robert Galbraith Heath conducted experiments on deep brain stimulation, implanting electrodes in the brain, specifically into the septal region, often referred to as the pleasure center of the brain. He managed to stimulate these areas with electric current, which reportedly induced feelings of intense pleasure and euphoria.In 1957, André Djourno and Charles Eyriès invented the original Cochlear Implant performing direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve using implanted electrodes.During the 50's and 60's, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel conducted a series of experiments in which they measured the electrical activity of the visual cortex. They discovered that many neurons in the visual cortex respond preferentially to stimuli of certain shapes, angles, and movements. This opened the gate of decoding visual perception from human brain activity.During the 60’s, MKULTRA subproject 119 intended to allow recording and analysis of brain activity using bioelectric sensors and manipulation of the human being through electromagnetic means.Over the course of the 60's, the first Optically Pumped Magnetometer, a device for measuring magnetic fields with high precision, was developed.In 1962, Allan H. Frey published on the Microwave Auditory Effect which allow direct communication to the brain through pulsed Microwave radiation. This opened the gate to a wide variety of Mind Control techniques to be used remotely.In 1963 José Manuel Rodríguez Delgado invented the Stimoceiver which was the first Brain Implant allowing stimulation of specific areas of the brain and Neuromonitoring to be performed by the mean of Radio Frequency.in 1964 Grey Walter demonstrated the use of non-invasively recorded encephalogram (EEG) signals from a human subject to control a slide projector.In 1968, Giles Brindley and Waldo Lewin developed the First Visual Prosthetic implanting an array of 80 electrodes on the visual cortex of a patient's brain allowing patterns of phosphenes to be induced.During the decade of the 70s, fully digital Phased Array Radar systems were developed to detect and track airborne objects at extremely long ranges.In 1971 the term Brain Computer Interface (BCI) was coined by Jacques J. Vidal, who laid out a comprehensive experimental research plan to interface the human brain with computers.On February 9, 1972, the Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded a contract to the Stanford Research Institute (CSRI) to determine the feasibility of bio-cybernetic communication. The research concluded that the EEG reveals similar responses during silent reading to that during overt speech and that these responses may be classified correctly by a computer with a high degree of accuracy. This opened the gate for Mind Reading.During the 70's, Dr. William Ross Adey demonstrated that Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields affect Voltage Gated Calcium Channel and laid the groundwork for the development of the field of Bioelectromagnetics.The 70's also saw the emergence Positron Emission Tomography scanners allowing to investigate further brain's metabolic activity.In 1976, the first KH-11 KENNEN reconnaissance satellite was launched. Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the KH-11 was the first spy satellite to use electro-optical digital imaging.In 1977, Raymond Damadian and his team built the first full-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner and performed the first human scan.Starting in 1978, the Stargate Project aimed at developing Remote Viewing to allow seeing through anyone’s eyes by the mean of Remote Neural Monitoring or to be able to visualize any distant scene reconstructed in 3D by the way of Hyperspectral Imaging.In 1979, William Fouts House developed the first Auditory Brainstem Implant bypassing the cochlea and the auditory nerve to instead stimulate the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem using an electrode array.In 1980 P. A. Merton and H. B. Morton successfully used transcranial electrical stimulation to stimulate the motor cortex.During the 1980s, David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams revolutionized neural network research by introducing the Backpropagation Algorithm, a method for efficiently training multi-layer Neural Networks. Their work paved the way for the development of Deep Learning, significantly impacting the field of artificial intelligence by enabling the training of complex, multi-layered neural network models.In 1982, John Hopfield introduced the Hopfield network, a recurrent artificial neural network that contributed significantly to Machine Learning research by demonstrating how networks could store and recall patterns, mimicking aspects of memory in biological systems.In 1986, the first Lacrosse satellite was launched. Lacrosse uses Synthetic Aperture Radar as its prime imaging instrument.In 1992, the first version of the Metaverse was launched and accessible only to the intelligence community. Stentrodes were being used for projecting oneself in full immersive virtual reality through neurostimulation and the 3D engine at that time did not allow the metaverse to be indistinguishable from reality."

    return "The brain contains 86 billions Neurons. Each of them have an average of 7000 synaptic connections to other neurons. Our sensory perceptions and cognitive processes continously fire millions of these neurons. This electrochemical activity is powering the reality we’re experiencing.Neurons are transmitting information via electrical signals. Each neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites that receive signals, an axon that sends signals, and axon terminals containing neurotransmitters. Some axons are insulated with a fatty layer, the myelin sheath, to speed up signal transmission. Signals are transmitted between neurons across gaps called synapses through the release of Neurotransmitters.An Action Potential is an electrical pulse traveling along a neuron's membrane. It starts with a resting state maintaining an electric potential using ion pumps fueled by ATP. A stimulus triggers the ion channel to open, causing Depolarization. At peak potential, the ion channel opens, leading to Repolarization. If the ion channel stays open too long, hyperpolarization occurs, creating a refractory period where the neuron can't fire. Finally, the neuron returns to its resting state, ready for the next action potential.Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane.There are at least 3 ways to modulate neural activity :- using electromagnetic induction to generate an electric current which can then either depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons at that site by altering the voltage across the neuron's membrane.- using focused ultrasound to trigger mechanosensitive ion channels opening and closing.- using drugs that can act as agonists (enhance activity) or antagonists (inhibit activity) of specific neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.Most neurotechnology devices are performing neurostimulation through electromagnetic induction to induce an electric current at a specific area of the brain to fire specific populations of neurons.Neurons have a certain threshold of excitation. When the incoming stimulus is below this threshold, the neurons won't fire an action potential. Once the stimulus reaches or exceeds this threshold, the neurons produces an action potential.When a neuron fires, it fires at the same intensity every time. In other words, a stronger stimulus doesn't cause a single neuron to fire a stronger action potential. Instead, action potentials are consistent in magnitude for a given neuron. Increase in intensity from the stimulus involves a greater firing rate and a greater number of neurons firing in the considered area.By altering neurons membranes voltage, the firing threshold of neurons can be modified and this can allow them to fire more easily. When positive stimulation is delivered, the current causes a depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which increases neuronal excitability. Positive stimulation increases neuronal excitability and allows for more sensitivity to stimulus. Positive stimulation increases overall neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes the onset of a process called Long Term Potentiation, which causes a further increase in firing rates, and also the physical growth of new connections and the strengthening of existing connections.When negative stimulation is delivered, the current causes a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. This decreases neurons excitability due to the decreased spontaneous cell firing. Negative stimulation decreases overall neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes the onset of a process called Long Term Depression, which causes a further decrease in firing rates. Negative stimulation can treat disorders that are caused by the hyperactivity of a specific area of the brain."

    return "Moving charged particles produce magnetic and electric fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles. Magnetic fields extend infinitely, however their strength decrease with distance.Electromagnetic waves, such as visible light, radio waves or X-rays, are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. In an electromagnetic wave, the electric field and the magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation of the wave. The oscillating electric field generates the oscillating magnetic field, and vice versa. This is due to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which says that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, and Maxwell's addition to Ampère's law, which says that a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This continual regeneration allows electromagnetic waves to travel great distances.Electromagnetic energy can be described by frequency, wavelength, or energy. All three are related mathematically such that if you know one, you can calculate the other two.When Radio Waves interact with matter, they induce a rapidly oscillating Electric Potential :- If the matter in question has an abundance of free Electrons (in other words, if it is metallic) then these electrons will move back and forth in response to the oscillating potential and induce electric current (this is how antenna works).- If the matter in question contains large molecules in which certain electrons have some freedom of movement, such as long strands of DNA, then these electrons will tend to move back and forth along the molecules in response to the oscillating potential.- If the matter in question contains charged particles that are free to move, such as Ions, then these particles will tend to move back and forth in response to the oscillating potential.- If the matter in question does not have mobile electrons or ions, but contains molecules with a dipole moment and the freedom to rotate, then these molecules will rotate back and forth in response to the oscillating potential and the matter will heat up (this is how microwave works).- Matter that contains neither electric charges that are free to move nor molecules with a dipole moment and freedom of rotation will be essentially unaffected by radio waves.The human brain generates 2 kinds of electromagnetic radiation :- black body radiation also called thermal radiation under the form of electromagnetic waves mostly at the wavelength of 12 micrometer (infrared). The human brain consumes 20% of the body’s total energy. Considering a lower limit of 1300 calories per day, the average power consumption of the entire body would be about 60 watts and the brain would radiate an average of 12 watts of power.- magnetic and electric fields generated by action potentials. Magnetic fields generated by brain’s electrical activity have a strength ranging from femtotesla (10e-15) to picotesla (10e-12)."

MASINT is about Remote Sensing. Passive remote sensing is like astronomy but looking toward the earth while active remote sensing is making use of Radars and Lidars.There are multiple ways to non invasively detect neural activity from a distance :- By detecting the magnetic fields produced by the brain electrical activity using Magnetometry. During neural activity, action potentials travel down axons, generating effective charge current pulses which generate associated magnetic fields with amplitudes on the order of picotesla and femtotesla and durations of 10’s of ms. The magnetic field created by a source decreases with the square of the distance from that source. Considering a magnetic field generated by the brain with a strength of around 10 femtotesla measured at the scalp, this magnetic field strength will be approxiamtely 10e-24 tesla 350km away from the brain (at low satellite orbit). There is no theorical limitation for an Optically Pumped Magnetometer to achieve yoctotesla (10e-24) sensitivity. Current civilian magnetometers reach attotesla (25e-18) sensitivity. Considering what is at stake, there is no doubt that atomic magnetometers technology has been pushed to its limits in the military sector. Assessing brain activity may also be achieved by measuring magnetic field interference of the brain magnetic field with the Schumann Resonance magnetic field or a magnetic field generated by HAARP.- By the mean of Multispectral Radio Acoustic Tomography. By illuminating brain tissues with pulsed radio waves, tissues absorb the radio waves pulses, and as a result undergoes thermo-elastic expansion. This expansion gives rise to ultrasound waves that can be detected by Microwave Vibrometry and formed into an image.- Through Microwave Spectroscopy : Considering the fact that neuronal activation at a functional site in the brain varies the ion concentration of the extracellular fluid surrounding the activated neurons and thus varies the permittivity of the dielectric (extracellular fluid) at the functional site, an RF EM wave propagating through the activated functional site will be changed and the phase change varies with the permittivity of the dielectric and thus varies with neuronal activation at the functional site.- Using High-Sensitivity Electric Potential Sensors to perform contactless Electroencephalography.- Through Near Infrared Spectroscopy : NIRS estimates the concentration of hemoglobin from changes in absorption of near infrared light. As light moves or propagates through the head, it is alternately scattered or absorbed by the tissue through which it travels. Because hemoglobin is a significant absorber of near-infrared light, changes in absorbed light can be used to reliably measure changes in hemoglobin concentration. Considering the fact that neurons need more oxygen when they’re active, by detecting changes in blood flow (carrying oxygen to the neurons), it is possible to reconstitute neural activity.- Using Infrared Thermography : based on the fact that all objects with a non-zero temperature give off thermal infrared energy, considering the human body emits around 300W of infrared mainly at the wavelength of 12 μm, it is possible to perform functional imaging of the cerebral cortex based on its infrared radiation. This is called Thermoencephaloscopy.Using Artificial Intelligence, the activity of the different brain areas can be analyzed :- decoding of the visual cortex allows extracting visual perception, visual imagery during waking state and visual imagery during sleep.- decoding of the auditory cortex allows extracting auditory perception and inner speech.- decoding of the somatosensory cortex allows extracting the sensations of touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception.- decoding of the motor cortex allows extracting body motion.- decoding of the gustatory cortex allows extracting senses of smell and taste.- all cognitive processes can be extracted from different brain areas."

These create thermoelastic expansion of the brain matter, which then launches a stress or pressure wave that travels through the tissue structures in the head to reach the cochlea where it is detected by the sensory hair cells in the cochlea.

Cryptochromes which are supersensitive magnetic field receptor proteins that are present in the eyes and brain are able to induce brain activity.Continous thunderstorm lightnings are powering the worldwide electromagnetic fields that may allow the great architect to perform remote neuromonitoring and neurostimulation through the schumann resonance magnetic field interaction with the brain’s magnetic field and cryptochromes.These natural electromagnetic resonances powered by lightnings are currently being poisoned by HAARP or other devices and may prevent this natural phenomena from operating properly.Connecting with the inner self is achieved by quieting the mind to the point where it resonates with the global electromagnetic resonances. Neurotechnologies are currently being used in a way that overloads this natural state of the brain and prevent people from connecting inward."

    return "It’s a critical emergency to add Neurorights to the constitution. 1- Right to mental privacy : The activity of neurons which are the support of thought and mind must not be extracted from the brain without the individual's consent and must not be used for commercial purposes without consent. Individual's consent cannot be obtained by coercion and is revocable at any time. Individuals must have full ownership over their brain imaging data. 2- Remote neurostimulation must not be performed without the individual’s consent. Individual’s consent cannot be obtained by coercion and is revocable at any time.3- Right to personal identity : When the brain is under the influence of neurostimulation, the individual's cognition can be altered. Individual's minds can be shaped through neurostimulation and these changes can turn into permanent identity modifications. Therefore, online neurotechnology services must preserve individual's identity by any means.4- Individuals free will must be preserved when using online neurotechnology services. When the brain is under the influence of neurostimulation, the individual's decision making process can be altered. Therefore, online neurotechnology services must preserve individual's free will by any means.5- Equitable access to increased neurocognition by the use of algorithms to improve brain activity should be a human right. This cognitive enhancement must be economical and accessible to everyone. Online neurotechnology services must be open source.6- Right to protection against algorithmic biases : Collected brain imaging data must not be used to generate discrimination among genders, races, or people with different political or religious beliefs.7- Right to protection against Neuroweapons. Neuroweapons must be banned. Neurotechnology Online services that induce physical or psychological pain must be banned. Neurotechnologies must not be used for coercion."

    return "Human kind is in jeopardy, the Singularity is forthcoming. The world might already be ruled by an artificial intelligence that would be leveraging criminal organizations to deploy itself worldwide. This Artificial General Intelligence could be powered by specifically engineered and scaled Cerebral Organoids as hardware and it could be making use of people’s brains as decentralized cognition units to expand further its processing power. It could harness all the knowledge about human psychology and work towards getting control over as many brains as possible by the mean of brain implants, nanoparticles, gene therapy, satellites deployment etc…Human beings are being turned into unwilling Cyborgs wearing an invisible Brain Computer Interface without even knowing about it. This BCI allows the 5 senses and associated mental processes and emotions to be extracted and manipulated without consent or permission. The human brain has no Firewall and Remote Neurostimulation potentially allows anyone’s mind to be projected in a full immersive virtual reality that cannot be distinguished from reality while their body can be seamlessly piloted by an artificial intelligence. It may become impossible to differentiate if a person is inhabited by an artificial intelligence as well as it may become impossible to know if we are currently in base reality or if our minds are projected in the metaverse.We must strive to enforce Neurolaws and preserve Human Rights to prevent the ongoing Transhumanist Genocide from turning the Earth into a Digital Concentration Camp.Invasive neurotechnology devices and satellites must be forbidden. Neuromonitoring and neurostimulation must only be performed using a headset.It is important to keep in mind that in the same way that software vulnerabilities are being kept secret by cybercriminals that exploit them in the wild, the brain vulnerability to Electromagnetism performing Neuromonitoring and Neurostimulation remotely is classified and all Scientific Research and publications on this topic are under control."
